# Odin Recipes

This is my first project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations curriculum.

## 🧑🏽‍🍳 Project Goal

The goal of this assignment was to build a basic HTML website that showcases a few recipes using only the skills learned so far — especially:
- HTML boilerplate
- Headings, paragraphs, and lists
- Image embedding
- Relative file paths and linking between pages

## ✅ What I Achieved

- Created a multi-page recipe website using only HTML.
- Learned how to organize folders (`images/`, `recipes/`) and use relative paths.
- Practiced writing semantic HTML structure.
- Fixed common issues with file paths and Git commit messages.
- Gained confidence using Git and GitHub from the terminal.

## 📁 Structure

- `index.html` — homepage with links to recipes.
- `recipes/` — folder containing individual recipe pages like `fried_chicken.html`.
- `images/` — folder storing recipe images.

## 🚀 What's Next

I’m looking forward to learning **CSS** next and applying styles to make this site visually appealing.

## 💬 Reflection

It feels great to build something from scratch using only HTML! Small wins like fixing a broken image path or cleaning up a list structure were surprisingly satisfying. Onward to the next challenge!
