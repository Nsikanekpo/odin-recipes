        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
            <li>1 cup frozen peas and carrots</li>
            <li>1/2 cup frozen corn</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, finely minced, or more to taste</li>
            <li>3 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>4 cups cooked rice</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons thinly sliced green onions</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce, or more to taste</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Step 1</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat sesame oil and olive oil in a large nonstick skillet or wok over medium-high heat.</li> 
            <li> Add shrimp and cook until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, about 3 minutes, flipping halfway through.</li>
        </ol>
        

        <h4>Step 2</h4>

        <ol>
           <li>Remove shrimp from the skillet using a slotted spoon, allowing oils and cooking juices to remain in the skillet</li>
           <li>Place shrimp on a plate and set aside.</li> 
        </ol>

        <h4>Step 3</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Add peas and carrots and corn to the skillet and cook, stirring intermittently, until vegetables begin to soften, about 2 minutes</li>
            <li>Add garlic; cook and stir for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Push vegetables to the side of the skillet, pour eggs into the other side, and cook to scramble, stirring as necessary, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Step 4</h4>

        <ol>
          <li>Stir shrimp, rice, and green onions into the skillet</li>
          <li> Drizzle evenly with soy sauce, season with salt and pepper, and stir to combine.</li>
          <li>Cook until shrimp is reheated through, about 2 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
